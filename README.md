BIMOS was my A-level computer science project. I created it to use in VR games that required realistic physical interaction like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/823500/BONEWORKS/">BONEWORKS</a>.

# Limitations
- Custom avatars aren't implemented
- Hands can sometimes get stuck inside of objects as the grab system teleports the hands to align them with the grabs
- Body colliders are centred around the head (too far forward)
- Bound to 144 Hz physics rate (jump height varies when changed)
- Feet jitter on moving platforms
- No haptics
